        <p>The water cycle describes the continuous circulation of water in the Earth;s atmosphere. Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Though the amount of water within the cycle remains basically constant, where it is in the process is continually changing.</p>

        <p>Evaporation is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earthâ€™s surface to the atmosphere via evaporation.</p>

        <p>Transpiration is the release of water vapor (gas) from plant leaves.</p>
        <p>Transpiration has three main steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Roots uptake water from the soil</li>
            <li>Water moves through plant tissues, serving critical metabolic and physiologic functions in the plant</li>
            <li>Leaves release water vapor into the air through their stomata</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is retuned to a liquid state; it is the opposite of evaporation. Condensation is important because it is responsible for forming clouds. These clouds may release precipitation, which is the main way for water to return to the Earth's surface. </p>

        <p>Precipitation is water released from clouds. Mostly in the form of rain, but also as freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail. Precipitation is the main way atmospheric water returns to the surface.</p>

        <p>Runoff is precipitation that runs off the landscape. It collects and pools in streams, creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes, seas, and oceans.</p>
