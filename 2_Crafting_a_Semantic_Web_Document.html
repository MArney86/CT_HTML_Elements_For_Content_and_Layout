        <p>Gunpla refers to plastic mecha model kits from Bandai, a Japanese entertainment company. The term itself comes from the Mobile Suit Gundam anime movie and TV series franchise, mixing the words Gundam and plastic model.</p>
        <p>Like other plastic model kits, Gundam model kits come molded in plastic sprues (sometimes called parts trees or runners). But Gunpla differ from most other model kits because they come molded in different colors and snap-fit together, meaning Gundam model kits often don&#39;t require glue or paint to build and finish. This makes Gunpla an excellent starting point for aspiring modelers to enter the hobby.</p>

        <p>To start building Gundam model kits, you&#39;ll need a kit. Gunpla kits come in different grades denoting degree of difficulty and price. A High Grade (HG) kit is one of the most affordable Gundam plastic model grades available and suitable for beginners. This Bandai HG 1/144 scale RGM-79&#91;G&#93; GM Ground Type EFSF mobile suit contains a moderate number of parts and looks great, even without paint.</p>

        <p>Next, to build Gundam model kits, you&#39;ll need some basic tools: nippers or side cutters, a hobby knife, and a variety of sanding sticks in grits from coarse to extra fine.</p>
        <p>Experienced Gunpla modelers recommend you have both a double-bladed and a single-bladed nipper. However, a single-bladed nipper can be an expensive tool, and isn&#39;t strictly necessary, so sticking with a double-bladed nipper for this kit is a good start.</p>
        <p>A cutting mat isn&#39;t a requirement, but it&#39;s a good idea to prevent damaging your work surface.</p>

        <p>Inside most Gundam model kits, you&#39;ll find the assembly instructions, stickers (and dry-transfer decals in Master Grade and higher), and three or four plastic bags with sprues full off parts molded in accurate colors for the subject. Some alphabetize the Gunpla runners in an organizer, but the box will work too.</p>

        <p>Instruction manuals for Gundam model kits are pretty easy to understand. Bandai prints some pages in color, and newer models comes with an English translation on the box and instructions. Even without any translation (like kits from before the 2010s), the Gunpla illustrations are straight forward, like IKEA instructions, and include a color painting guide for those that choose to take that step.</p>

        <p>Gundam model kit instructions indicate the parts you&#39; supposed to remove by the letter of the sprue and the number of the part. For example, Part A2 means go to Sprue A and find Part 2.</p>
        <p>Assembling a Gundam plastic model is easy as long as you follow the manual. When the parts don&#39; fit, do not force them together. You probably have the wrong part, you&#39; installing the part in the wrong place, or you have the part positioned incorrectly. Take your time and check the instructions.</p>
